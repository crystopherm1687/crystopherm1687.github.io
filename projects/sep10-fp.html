            <h1 class="margin text-center">Volleyball</h1>
            <h3>Context</h3>
            <p>For my project, I chose the topic of Volleyball.</p>
            <h3>Content</h3>
            <p>I am a student at HSTAT in the Software Engineering Program. The "Freedom Project" for SEP10 is a year-long project all about making a website that informs the viewer of the current and future innovations in the topic of my choosing.
            I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Github. I also chose to independently study Aframe in order to help me make my website.</p>
           <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <h4>Challenges</h4>
            <p>Some of the problems i encountered within the project was when i had to adjust the positioning of some elements which was very hard as i had use margin and padding when i could have added some box element and put it in its own category. Another problem i had was when i tried to add borders for the images the lining was all wrong and i didn't like how it like reacting to similar classes when i added their effects. During the project as i was choosing my own colors they suddenly started to change or go back to its original which was very annoying as some elements had color which i did not want but all i had to do was change the class for the object and i would be fine.</p>
            <h4>Takeaways</h4>
            <p>For some of the takeaways on this project i will always remember to set dates that things must be done because i only focused on a few things and didn't put much effort into the overall project except the aframe and it cost me so much valuable time to code an amazing website. Another big takeaway that should happen is that i should dedicate time for doing hard tasks like schoolwork as it could take hours like the freedom project so that once i am done with the project i can do something extra and make good presentation slides without disrupting my schedule. Other takeaways for my project include always asking for help debugging things as i had some trouble with developing the overall project but it is not possible for me to do everything alone so i have to adjust and make separate changes. Also making sure to make small edits everyday can help boost your progress so you won't have to worry about cramming edits in one go and stressing before the due date. </p>
            <h4>Next Steps</h4>
           <p>For future projects i will attempt to set time aside and plan things in a timely fashion to avoid problems, bugs and family events outside of school so that i'm prepared for a school session or class itself. Other steps include me being resposible for doing tasks beforehand to avoid multitasking at night while setting time for different activities that would happen later. Lastly learning more concepts outside of school will help change my learning and allow me to be more efficent and not start lacking so i can obtain better grades and feel peace of mind when i'm outside haning out with family or friends.</p>
